## Inspiration
Rowdymon was inspired by retro collectable games, like Pok√©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh!

## What it does
Rowdymon is an app in which you can scan Rowdymon Codes to see an AR representation of the creature/object, the more you scan the higher your score will be! _Gotta scan them all!!!_

## How we built it
Rowdymon was built using Unity3D and made use of the Unity AR Foundational toolkit. The art assets were expertly crafted by the team and the Creature codes were created using Python's QR library.

## Challenges we ran into
Image Detection and AR can be finicky especially when demoing with onscreen codes, we soon found out that image tracking on a computer monitor produces ample noise and interference. After the team switched to paper we found development flowed much easier!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a functional AR app with handmade assets being the centerpiece, was difficult but extremely rewarding endeavor, we are proud not only on the technical aspects but the quality of the art presented.

## What we learned
From all perspectives the team was pushed into unfamiliar territory, from exploring a new artistic pixilation art style to interacting with unfamiliar APIs and mobile app development. All of us are taking away new skills and experience from this project.

## What's next for Rowdymon AR Card Game
The tech behind Rowdymon could be expanded to utilize a backend API, allowing for uniqueness and variety to a multitude of possible markets. From displaying a custom AR DnD character to showcasing the latest car model from a business card.
